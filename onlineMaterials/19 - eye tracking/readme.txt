Visual search task with eye tracking
===============================================

This is a variant of the visual search experiment originally described in
Chapter 9. In Chapter 19, we show how to add the capability to record eye
movements whilst the participant is performing the task.

This experiment will likely not run for you immediately: you will need to edit
the .yaml configuration files to match the requirements of your particular eye
tracker. You might also need to install the SDK (software development kit) or
API (application programming interface) provided by your particular eye tracker
manufacturer. This is so that PsychoPy (and in particular the ioHub library)
has a route to communicate with and control your tracker.
