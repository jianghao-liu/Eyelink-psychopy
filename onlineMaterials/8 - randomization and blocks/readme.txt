The Stroop task with blocking
===============================================

This experiment shows an extension of the Stroop task that presents two blocks
of trials, one in English and one in MƒÅori. The order of blocks can be made
constant or can vary across subjects.

Implementation
-------------------

Note that this version of the experiment differs a little from the one described
in Chapter 8. In particular, it includes some analysis code so that the
participant gets some immediate feedback on the magnitude of the Stroop
interference effect in each language at the end of the experiment.

Extensions
-------------------

In Chapter 8, a number of ways of controlling the order of blocks via the outer
loop are discussed. Try changing this experiment to accomplish one of them
e.g. specifying the block order by entering a value in a field in the
experiment information dialog box that is displayed at the start of the task.
