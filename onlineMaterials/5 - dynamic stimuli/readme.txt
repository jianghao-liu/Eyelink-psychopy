Various dynamic stimuli
===============================================

This folder doesn't contain a single experiment, as created in the other
chapters but, rather, a series of different dynamic effects applied to a
variety of stimuli. As such, we have also made a few changes to the Experiment
Settings. We have removed the dialog box at the beginning (turn off "Show info
dialog") and we have made the window a fixed size of (400,600) pixels rather
than it being full-screen. These are often good practice while you develop a
study but when you come to run it you should probably turn them back on.

Four of the examples here are discussed fully in the book text:

  - reveal gradual: shows text being revealed by a smoothly moving mask
  - rotating faces: shows how to rotate and expand an image in real-time
  - rainbow text: gradually change the text color to move through the rainbow
  - heart throb: control the size of a stimulus to make it look like a "pulse"

An additional demo, not discussed in the book, is included to show further a
further example of what is possible:

Flash drag effect (see XXX): a textured disc rotates and, periodically, changes
direction. At the same time as the direction change occurs a pair of red circles
appear, centered on the vertical midline. These have an illusion of appearing
rotated from the vertical in the direction the larger texture was just moving.
For further examples of how to implement a variety of visual illusions (using
PsychoPy Coding rather than Builder), there is a dedicated book that you might
find interesting (Bertamimi, 2017).
