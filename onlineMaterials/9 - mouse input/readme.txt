Visual search task with mouse responses
===============================================

This is a simple visual search task that shows the difference between rapid search for a stimulus that pops out pre-attentively vs slower serial search for stimulus that varies more subtly from the distractors.

As described in Chapter 9, the teaching purpose of the experiment is to show how to use the mouse to gather spatial responses.

Extensions
--------------

- Try changing other visual aspects of the stimulus when the mouse hovers over it (e.g. changing the contrast or color).
- Create a new experiment and make the position of a stimulus contingent on the mouse pointer location (i.e. enable the participant to click and drag stimuli around on the screen).
