Stroop with practice and feedback
=============================================================

This exercise takes the `stroopExtended` demo, which is included with PsychoPy
(in the demos menu of the Builder view) and differs from the main Stroop in that
it has two loops, one for practice trials (which also have feedback added) and
one for the main trials (more repeats and with no feedback provided).

What this example adds to that stroopExtended demo is feedback to the participant
about their running average performance over the last 5 trials.

Implementation
----------------

Take a look at the code that has been added to the `feedback` Routine, in the Code
Component called `message`.
