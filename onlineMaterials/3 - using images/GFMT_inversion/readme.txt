Measuring the face inversion effect with the GFMT
========================================================

These files use a version of the short-form GFMT (Burton et al, 2010) to demonstrate the face inversion effect, as part of the materials for the book Chapter 5 of "Building experiments in PsychoPy" (Peirce and MacAskill, 2018).

The task
--------------

On each trial a pair of faces are presented and the participant must respond, with the arrows on the keyboard, whether the faces are of the same (left arrow) or different (right arrow) individuals. Participants are free to view the faces for as long as they like.

In this version of the task, however, the faces are sometimes presented upright, whereas sometimes they are inverted.

Extensions
--------------

As explained in the book, this version of the task is simplified and could be improved in various ways. Notably, you might like to add a Routine to present instructions and another at the end of the trials to say "Thanks for taking part!".

Also note that the images are white and this might look strange on the gray background of the screen. You might like to change that to be white instead (change the color in the "screen" section of the Experiment Settings).
