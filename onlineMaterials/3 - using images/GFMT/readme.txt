The (short) Glasgow Face Matching Task
===============================================

These files provide a simple, but working, version of the short-form GFMT (Burton et al, 2010), as part of the materials for the book "Building experiments in PsychoPy" (Peirce and MacAskill, 2018).

The images of this short-form version of the test, and an extended version, are freely available from Mike Burton's website at http://www.facevar.com/downloads/gfmt

The task
--------------

On each trial a pair of faces is presented and the participant must respond, with the arrows on the keyboard, whether the images are of the same (left arrow) or different (right arrow) individuals. Participants are free to view the faces for as long as they like.

Extensions
--------------

As explained in the book (Chapter 3), this version of the task is simplified for teaching purposes and it could be improved in various ways. Most obviously, you might like to add a Routine to present instructions and another at the end of the trials to say "Thanks for taking part!".
