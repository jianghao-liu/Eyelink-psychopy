Change contrast with mouse hover
=======================================

This demo shows you how to change the contrast of an image by hovering over it
with the mouse. Try moving your mouse over the different image and seeing what
happens! You can press the mouse button to advance to the next "trial"

Solution
-----------------

All we needed for this was to add a Mouse component, which we've called mouse,
and then set a code component to check whether the stimulus 'contains' the
mouse location and updated the stimulus contrast accordingly.
