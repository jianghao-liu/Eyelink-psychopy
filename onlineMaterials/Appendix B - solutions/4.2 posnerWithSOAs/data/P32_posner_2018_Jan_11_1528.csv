Here we created a pivot tablewith the following settings:,,,,,,,
,filter=,resp.corr,then set this to 1 (below) if you want only correct responses,,,,
,rows=,SOA,,,,,
,columns=,valid,,,,,
,value=,resp.rt,set this to use the average not the sum,,,,
We then copied that over to the right to make the lables prettier (milliseconds rather than frames etc),,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
resp.corr,1,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Average of resp.rt,Column Labels,,,,,,
Row Labels,0,1,Grand Total,,SOA (ms),invalid,valid
