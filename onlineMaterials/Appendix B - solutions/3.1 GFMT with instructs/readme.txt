The (short) Glasgow Face Matching Task
===============================================

Here we've added a Routine to present instructions, ending on a keypress, and
another to say "Thanks", which simply ends after 2 seconds. 

You could add these Routines manually or by copying and pasting them 
from another study (in the Experiment menu).
