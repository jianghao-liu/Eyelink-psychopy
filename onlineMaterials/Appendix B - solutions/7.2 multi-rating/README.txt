Blocking trials in PsychoPy Builder
=======================================

Simply inserting more than one rating scale object to a Routine, and remembering to position them in different parts of the screen, is not too hard. The thing that can be tricky is trying to set up the scales correctly so that responses can be collected from more than one! For instance, by default, the rating scale is set to end the Routine when it has a response but if you leave that setting turned on then the participant cannot respond to the other scale!
