The (short) Glasgow Face Matching Task
===============================================

These files provide a simple, but working, version of the short-form GFMT
(Burton et al, 2010), as part of the materials for the book "Building
experiments in PsychoPy" (Peirce and MacAskill, 2018).

In this demo we've inserted some practice trials that show you how to use a
Routine (trial) in more than one loop (practice and main, in this case). You
can have different numbers of trials as well as different conditions files
for each loop (e.g. 1 rep of 6 conditions in the practice, then 5 reps of 10
conditions in the main trials).

NOTE: In most experiments you would use different stimuli in the practice and
main trials, but we didn't really have enough different trials to do that here.
