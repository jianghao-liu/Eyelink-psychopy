Exercise 2.3: Make the reverse Stroop task
============================================================

Again it would be tempting, but inefficient, to recreate the entire experiment
to measure the reverse Stroop effect. The structure of your trials isn't
changing here, just the conditions that you are presenting.

Solution
------------------------

You need to change:

  - the corrAns column in the conditions.xlsx file, to match the word rather than
    the letter color, because that is what the participants are now supposed to
    attend to
  - the instructions, to tell participants to focus on the word, not the letters
