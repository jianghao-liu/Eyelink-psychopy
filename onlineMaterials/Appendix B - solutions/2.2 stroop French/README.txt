Exercise 2.2: Make the French Stroop task
============================================================

It would be tempting to go and change your whole experiment to get a French
version but that really isn't necessary. The structure of your trials isn't
changing here, just the conditions that you are presenting.

Solution
------------------------

Simply edit the conditions.xlsx file so that the word variable is rouge, vert
and bleu. Make sure you keep the letterColor in English (red, green and blue)
because PsychoPy itself doesn't understand French!
