Exercise 2.1: Make the screen background black
============================================================

In experiment settings (in the toolbar) there is a tab for "Screen". In this tab
one of the options is Color and by default this is set to be $[0,0,0] which is
PsychoPy's numerical value for the mid-grey of the screen.

Solution
------------------------

Simply replace that value, $[0,0,0] with the word black and you're all done!
